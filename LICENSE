You are free to use these fonts for non-commercial use and you can also use them
free for commercial use but, if you are using them commercially, I ask  you to
make a  payment in the same way that you would not expect to get your electricity
for free; or your production equipment for free. The artistic and technological
work involved in producing, maintaining and distributing these fonts costs me
money as well as a lot of my time and I would like to be able to have more of my
time to devote to font production.

You are not free to modify the fonts in any way and then distribute the modified
versions. Any modifications you might perform on a font file cannot be distributed.
If you want a file to be modified, ask me to do it.
My email address is: paul.alan.grosse@gmail.com. This is the same email address
as the one used to make payments to me through PayPal.

You are not free to charge for the fonts in any way.

The fonts are provided equally to those who can and cannot afford to pay for fonts
and in order to continue to do this, the above conditions need to be adhered to.
